Their ability to summon animals in battle has made them feared warriors all over the world and one should think twice before penetrating the dark forests they protect.",
'Dracoids'		=>"A distant relative to the mighty dragons. Without the great stature and strength of their grander relatives the Dracoids rely solely on their magic powers in combat, with hard scales covering their bodies as a second armor. Their main weak points are their slow learning curve and their lack of interest in gold. A Dracoid typically gain strength slowly but is a formidable foe for anyone who isn't cautious.",
'Drow'		=>"A long time ago a great war raged amongst the elves. As a result of the battle the losers was banished from the light and forced to live in the underground caves known as Underdark.

They have inherited the magical capabilities from the Elves while the union has led to a weakening of their strength.",
'Hydroids'		=>"The Hydroids absorbs the free magic in the air through their skin, which causes a faint glow that can be seen at night. They use this magic as energy source and have no need to eat. The tradeoff for using magic as energy source is that their endurance would decrease heavily if they were to use any major magic. The Hydroids makes up for this through the strength they gain from the energy, and after killing an enemy they sap the remaining magic energies from the body thereby sapping a portion of the enemies knowledge.",
'Ogre'		=>"One of the largest intelligent creatures there is. These large omnivorous eat anything from trees to humans, as long as it is edible they go for it.

Aside from gaining great offensive magic they coat their armors with the blood of their enemies further increasing the effectiveness of their protection.",

Aside from their physical might the Trolls are also gifted with a great resistance against magic.

They fear fire and they have several soft spots in their otherwise though skin.",
'Undead'		=>"The Undead is not a race as much as it is a condition. The Undead keeps the shape of its former life but the mind is reshaped to a point where most of the memory and knowledge is lost. Gone is also all self preservation and fear making it the perfect killing machine. How do you kill something really isn't alive? The answer is simple: With great care. The weak point of the undead is that they are very vulnerable for magic attacks as their minds are deeply regressed from the state of death.",
"Centaurs"	=>"Centaurs are one of the most reclusive beings in the world tending to keep to the forests rather than mingling in open areas among Humans and other two legged beings. They are quite attune with nature as are Elves, and develop bonds with nature. Never will a Centaur take more than they needs from the land, if forced to, for instance cut down a tree.",
"Minotaurs"	=>"Among the largest bipedal creatures is the Minotaur, topping over eight feet with horns cresting out of the sides of it's skull.

These goat-mens do not wander far from their home and are only offensive towards others intruders",
"Wemics"		=>"Wemics, another race of half beast half man heritage like Minotaurs and Centaurs. Wemics though are half lion and half man beings that live more on their beast side. Their body is of a lion and their upper torso like Centaurs is humanoid.",
"Pseudo Dragon"	=> "They are small winged reptile like creatures from an unknown world that look like miniature dragons. They have a slightly more solid build than full sized dragons and they can be Blue, Grey, Green, or White in color. Even though they have a life span of 400 years, they mature in about two years. As many types of dragons can take a humanoid stance so can pseudo dragons and their for forward feet can be used as hands with 60% of the ability of human hand. The creatures is Sentient and have a spoken language that can be understood with enough listening but cannot be spoken by a person. This language is instinctively know by all members of the species. They also can understand after some listening, most other creatures tongues although they do not have the vocals to speak those those languages either. They are quite adept at learning human body language and can easily be understood using the Tongues spell. They form mated pairs on their home planet and that pair will normally work with one or two other mated pairs. This complex bonding often means that when not with their species, they will form emotional bonds with humans and other races and remain very loyal to them.",
