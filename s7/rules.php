a problem with what someone did or has said then take it to messages...No 
one wants to see 2 people fighting over stupid things...It ruins the 
game...So if you must fight with someone then do it where the rest of the 
people that are playing the game cant see it...If you are fighting with 
someone a Mod/ Cop/ Admin will warn you to stop it...if you do not stop then 
the Mod/ Cop/ Admin has the option to ask you to stop again or Mute/ Jail 
you. SO BE WARNED DON'T FIGHT IN THE CHAT!!!
Spamming
<p>
You are not allowed to spam .. Spamming is posting in chat or messages 
anything that could be found annoying. It is also when you repeatedly type 
the same message over and over again.. It is really annoying and it is not 
permitted in this game so if you want to spam go play a different game. The 
game is designed for people to have fun not read stupid things that people 
say that might offend someone..
<p>
</td></tr><tr><th><b>Rules for messages</b></th></tr><tr><td>
You are also NOT allowed at any time to send someone a message asking 
for EXP, Gold, Credits, Charms. if you send a message begging for any of 
these items then you will be warned only once then you will be 
jailed/muted...SO BE WARNED DO NOT BEG FOR ANYTHING....If someone wants to 
help you out they will ask you if you need help.... Your best bet is just to 
sit their and do your best and be nice to everyone then you will more then 
likely receive help...
<p>
You are also not allowed to cuss in messages.. You are not allowed to 
say the following words in messages. Fu*k, bit*h, ass, hoe, slut, whore, 
cunt, di*k. dike, cum, faggit, gay, retarted, suck, fudge packer or any 
present past or future tense of the words... If you receive a message that 
you find offensive that contains any of those words then copy it and send it 
to a Mod/Cop/Admin and they will deal with it... For your first offence 
depending on what was said you will either receive a warning or be muted.
<p>
</td></tr><tr><th><b>Being Muted/ Jailed</b></th></tr><tr><td>
If you believe that you were Muted / Jailed for no reason Contact the 
Mod/ Cop / Admin that Muted/ Jailed you and ask them why they did it... 
Remember to save the Message they send you... Then Contact another Mod/ Cop 
/ Admin and tell them your side of the story.... But you do need proof 
showing that you did not break any of the rules. So if you don't have any 
kind of proof then the punishment that the other Mod/ Cop/ Admin chose for 
you will stand. No Mod/ Cop/ Admin will over turn a punishment unless their 
is just grounds for them to do so.
<p>
</td></tr><tr><th><b>Cops/ Admins bailing people out of jail</b></th></tr><tr><td>
It is not permitted for a Cop or Admin to bail someone out of jail if 
they were placed in jail for clicking too fast....It is tough luck that you 
got jailed that way and you should learn a lesson from not being able to 
play that character for a while....If a Cop/ Admin bails someone out of jail 
when the person was jailed for clicking too fast the Cop/ Admin will LOSE 
HIS TITLE because of it. Neo Silk stated that him self in the forums.
