A COUNCIL can not and may not mute or jail you without any reason.
If you feel that you were muted or jailed without a reason, tell your side of the story and/or show some kind of proof that you didn't break any rules to other COUNCIL('s) ...
Usually a copy of the chat and/or a copy of a message is enough....
A COUNCIL will not unmute or bail you out of jail unless you have some kind of proof that you didn't break the rules....
<p>
You cannot be muted and/or jailed for stating your opinion as long as it does not
break any other rules such as Spamming and profanity.
<p>
A WARNING MESSAGE is not required for multi rule breaking players and/or players that has broke the rule several times in the past.
If it's the first time for the player that you want to mute and/or jail you MUST send a WARNING MESSAGE before taking any action.

<tr><th><b><a name="#2">Chatting, Forum and Message language usage</a></b></th></tr>

<tr><td>

......Ass, Fu*k, bit*h, hoe, slut, whore, cunt, di*k. dike, cum, faggot,
gay, retarded, suck, shit, tramp, fudge packer or any present past or future
tense of the words. you are also not allowed to use any Racial Slurs or
Sexist Slurs. If you use any of the words you are to be warned by a
COUNCIL . If you do so choose to break the rules again by using
profanity or slurs then you will be MUTED...
<p>
You are not permitted to ask for free gold more then once in 25 messages that
YOU type...it is not considered 25 messages if you sit their not talking for
10 minuets then ask again. You are not permitted to ask for a challenge more
then once in 10 messages that YOU type... Asking over and over again for
free gold is considered begging...If you always beg then a Admin has the
option to change your title to Beggar. You will receive one warning for
breaking any of these rules.
<p>
YOU ARE NEVER PERMITTED TO ASK FOR FREE CREDITS ..You will recive 1 warning
from breaking any of these rules...If you break the rules day in and day out
you will have your title changed to a Danger, Untrust or Beggar by an Admin
and will be muted.
<p>
You are also not permitted to start arguments in the Chat. If you have a
problem with what someone did or has said then take it to messages...No one
wants to see 2 people fighting over stupid things...It ruins the game...So
if you must fight with someone then do it where the rest of the people that
are playing the game can not see it... If you are fighting with a COUNCIL, a COUNCIL will warn you to stop it...if you do not stop then the COUNCIL has the option to ask you again to stop it and/or force you to stop it by Muting and/or Jail you.
<p>
You are never permitted to start a fight with a COUNCIL... You will
receive one warning for starting a fight with them. Then you will be forced to stop by a mute, if you continue after you were asked to stop....
<p></td></tr>

<tr><th><b><a name="#3">Spamming</a></b></th></tr>

<tr><td>
You are not allowed to Spam .. Spamming is posting in chat or messages
anything that could be found annoying. It is also when you repeatedly type
the same message over and over again.. It is really annoying and it is not
permitted in this game so if you want to Spam go play a different game. The
game is designed for people to have fun not read stupid things that people
say that might offend someone..
<p></td></tr>

<tr><th><b><a name="#4">Rules for Messages</a></b></th></tr>

<tr><td>
You are also NOT allowed at any time to send someone a message asking for
EXP, Gold, Charms, and/or credits. if you send a message begging for any of these items then you will be warned only once then you will be forced by a mute and/or jail...SO BE WARNED DO NOT BEG FOR ANYTHING....If someone wants to help you out they will ask you.<br>
if you need help.... Your best bet is just to sit their and do your best and be nice to everyone then you will more then likely receive help...
<p>
You are NEVER allowed to message anyone asking for free credits...YOU
WILL NOT RECEIVE A WARNING BEFORE YOU ARE MUTED FOR DOING THIS.
<p>
You are also not allowed to cuss in messages.. You are not allowed to say
the following words in messages. Fu*k, bit*h, ass, hoe, slut, whore, cunt,
di*k. dike, cum, fagot, gay, retarded, suck, fudge packer or any present
past or future tense of the words... If you receive a message that you find
offensive that contains any of those words then copy it and send it to a
COUNCIL and they will deal with it... For your first offence depending
on what was said you will either receive a warning or be muted.
<p></td></tr>

<tr><th><b><a name="#5">Cops and/or Admins bailing people out of jail</a></b></th></tr>

<tr><td>
It is not permitted for a Cop or Admin to bail someone out of jail if they
were placed in jail for clicking too fast....It is tough luck that you got
jailed that way and you should learn a lesson from not being able to play
that character for a while.... If a Cop and/or Admin bails someone out of jail when
the person was jailed for clicking too fast the Cop and/or Admin will LOSE HIS
TITLE because of it.
<p></td></tr>

<tr><th><b><a name="#6">Bug Abuse</a></b></th></tr>

<tr><td>
If you discover a bug do not use it report it to Admin Silent.... If it is a
new and true bug you will be rewarded with credits...One common bug that has
been abused is the Gold Stacking bug....This is where you have a character
sit in shop and have another character send it a lot of gold and just
upgrade one time instead of several times to get the upgrades... If you are
caught using this bug or any other bug you will receive one warning....If
you choose to break the rules again by using the bug again you will be
muted and/or jailed and your title will be changed to Untrust or Danger. So be
warned don't use any bugs...
