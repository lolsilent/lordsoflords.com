<b>H</b>ow was this game made?<br>
Allot time and read all the guides of the programs listed above.I started with a Perl game that took 3 weeks to build then I decided to take a look at other programming languages when PHP4 came, I knew this was my language when I saw there documentation.Downloaded the program for IIS and manuals, while I was converting and reading the manuals how to use the commands, it took me 3 days to have a php game running. Now I have invested more than 6 months studying PHP I almost know every command. It's still useless if you know the commands but don't know how to use them, so I sometimes takes a look at the guide too.
